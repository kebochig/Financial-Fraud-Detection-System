ðŸ“¦ Project Title
"Detect Anomalous Transactions in Unstructured Financial Records"

ðŸ“œ Dataset Description
The dataset consists of raw transaction logs with minimal structure. Each row is a log entry from a financial system or a user-facing event log. Example formats:

î°ƒ{

"log": "2023-05-14 14:05:31 | user: 1023 | txn: withdrawal of Â£500 from ATM near Liverpool | device: Samsung Galaxy S10 | location: 53.4084,-2.9916"

}

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. Data Understanding & Parsing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Anomaly Detection
Choose one or more:

Rule-based (e.g., amount > X + new location â†’ suspicious)
Statistical / clustering (e.g., DBSCAN, Isolation Forest)
Sequence modeling (if temporal sequences are valuable)
Embedding + autoencoders (textual descriptions vectorized)
4. Evaluation
If labeled anomalies are available: precision, recall, etc.
If not:
Flag top-N anomalies with explanations
Visualize clusters or outliers
Provide a manual validation plan
5. Interpretability
Explain what makes an event anomalous (e.g., rare device+location pair)
Include confidence scores if possible
ðŸ’¾ Deliverables
Code (in Jupyter notebook or script)
Parser module for extracting structured features
Notebook visualizations of detected anomalies
README with:
Parsing logic explanation
Modeling approach
Findings & business impact
Optional: web demo (Streamlit, Flask) or CLI to parse and flag logs
