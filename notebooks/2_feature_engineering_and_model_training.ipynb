# Feature Engineering and Model Training

This notebook is designed to run through the feature engineering process, prepare the data, and then proceed to train and evaluate anomaly detection models for the fraud detection system.

## Setup

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from features import extract_features
from models import train_models, evaluate_models
```

## Load Data

```python
# Load the parsed data
data = pd.read_csv('data/parsed_transactions.csv')
```

## Feature Engineering

```python
# Extract features
data, feature_metadata = extract_features(data)

# Display the first few rows to verify
data.head()
```

## Model Training

```python
# Train various models
models = train_models(data, feature_metadata)
```

## Model Evaluation

```python
# Evaluate models with cross-validation and other metrics
results = evaluate_models(models, data)

# Display evaluation summary
results_summary = pd.DataFrame(results)
results_summary
```

## Visualization

```python
# Plot feature importance
results_summary.plot_feature_importance()

# Scatter plot of anomaly scores
results_summary.plot_anomaly_scores()
```

## Save Results

```python
# Save the trained models and results
results_summary.to_csv('data/model_evaluation_results.csv')
```

## Conclusion

This notebook outlines the feature engineering and model training process for the fraud detection system. The trained models and evaluation results provide insight into the effectiveness of different anomaly detection strategies.
